# Greenmon
 - Created for our IoT project aimed to automate a greenhouse, hence "Green" and "mon" for monitor.

## Why did we used Nuxt.js?
 - Vue.js is currently the only framework we had the most knowledge of at the time.
 - We want to utilize Nuxt's server-side rendering while sticking to Vue.js.
 - With a fullstack framework like Nuxt, there is no need for separate deployment of frontend and backend, as well as low latency between network communication with the backend api.
