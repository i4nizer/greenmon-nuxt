# iGreenMon
 - Created for our capstone project aimed to automate greenhouse using IoT, hence "i" for IoT, "Green" for greenhouse and "Mon" for monitoring.

## Why Nuxt?
 - Vue is currently the only framework we had the most knowledge of at the time.
 - We want to utilize Nuxt's server-side rendering while sticking to Vue.
 - With a fullstack framework like Nuxt, there is no need for separate deployment of frontend and backend, as well as low latency between network communication with the backend api.
