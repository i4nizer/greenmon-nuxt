    <h2>Unsuccessful Sign-In Attempt</h2>
    <p>Hi <%= name %>,</p>
    <p>
        We noticed a failed attempt to sign in to your Greenmon account.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this was you and you simply forgot your password, you can reset it using the "Forgot Password" option on the
        sign-in page.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you did not attempt to sign in, we recommend updating your password and reviewing your account activity for
        any suspicious behavior.
    </p>
